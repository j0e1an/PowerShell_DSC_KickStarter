# PowerShell_DSC_KickStarter
By using this file you can supply a list of Windows servers for the same DSC. This configuration is built on C# and will 
require Windows SDK and import the System.Management.Automation.dll file under C:\Program Files (x86)\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\WindowsPowerShell\3.0.
Otherwise, it will run on as a commandline tool to help you generate the mod file to apply to your servers.
