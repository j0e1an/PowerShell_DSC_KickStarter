# PowerShell_DSC_KickStarter
By using this program you can get the Desired State Configuration file (.mof) for servers that need the same configuration without the burden of creating them one by one. 
This configuration is built on C# and to use the source code you will need the Windows SDK and import the System.Management.Automation.dll file under C:\Program Files (x86)\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\WindowsPowerShell\3.0.
Otherwise, it will run as a command-line tool to help you generate the .mof file to apply to your servers.
