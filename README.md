# PowerShell_DSC_KickStarter
By using this program you can get the Desired State Configuration file (.mof) without the burden of creating them one by one. 
This configuration is built on C# and to use the source dode you will need the Windows SDK and import the System.Management.Automation.dll file under C:\Program Files (x86)\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\WindowsPowerShell\3.0.
Otherwise, it will run as a commandline tool to help you generate the mof file to apply to your servers.
